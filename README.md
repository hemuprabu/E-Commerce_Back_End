## Features:

Sync Sequelize to the Database on Server Start

Create the code needed in `server.js` to sync the Sequelize models to the PostgreSQL database on server start.

After creating the models and routes, run `npm run seed` to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

* `Product` belongs to `Category`, and `Category` has many `Product` models, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

* `Product` belongs to many `Tag` models, and `Tag` belongs to many `Product` models. Allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products by using the `ProductTag` through model.



### Database Models

Your database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

* `Category`

  * `id`

    * Integer.
